## Notes

The challenges encountered while building the app:

I only understood about 50% of why the TA did what he/she did in building the app.  
The "Apply Changes and Restart Activity" Button in Android Studio did not work well for me. I had to wipe data of the 
emulator, rebuild, and run the code whenever I would like to test a change.  
Shutting down the emulator using its own Power Button did not work well for me when I was building the app. Thus, 
there were many times where the emulator misbehaved and I had to wipe the data of the emulator. However I think the 
Power Button is working now, and I think I won't have to perform the wiping that many times in the future.  
My computer is not that strong. Thus, running the emulator and building and running the code took a good amount of time.
The whole process was not super fluent.  
The startActivityForResult function shown in the video is deprecated, and the alternative method for it is quite complex
to me. Thus, I could not finish the step 2.5 "Adding the Editing Feature".
